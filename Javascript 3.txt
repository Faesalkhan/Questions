This ----------------------------------
lets understand what 'this' is not. 'this' refers to the function itself (its wrong).

function foo(num) {
  console.log("count " + num);
  this.count++;
}
foo.count = 0;

for (var a = 0; a < 10; a++){
  if (a > 5) {
    foo(a);                      // 6, 7, 8, 9
  }
}
console.log(foo.count);          // 0,  wtf?

here, function foo is adding a property 'count' to the functions object foo.
but inside the foo, 'this' is not refering to function object foo. 

we need a identifier that will refer the function foo inside it. suppose we have,
function foo() {
  foo.count = 4;
  console.log(foo.count); 
}
foo();                         // 4
here foo inside the function declaration 'foo' is refering to itself (from inside). working fine.

consider,
setTimeout( function(){
// it is anonymous func
},1000);
here, callback func passed to setTimeout is not having any declaration, so there's no proper way to refer the function obj itself.

so solution to our problem could be refering the function foo using its declaration.
function foo(num) {
  console.log("count "+num);
  foo.count++
}
foo.count = 0;
for (var a = 0; a < 10; a++){
  if (a > 5) {
    foo(a);                   // 6, 7, 8, 9
  }
}
console.log(foo.count);       // 4

we'll see later how could we use the 'this' so solve our problem.

'this' refers to the function's (lexical) scope. its wrong.
in one sense there is some truth. but is not always true.

To be clear, 'this' does not, in anyway refer to function's lexical scope.

function foo() {
  var a = 9;
  this.bar();
}
function bar() {
  console.log(this.a);
}
foo();          // ReferenceError: undefined

we cannot use 'this' reference to look something up in a lexical scope. it is not possible.
there is no possible bridge between lexical scope look-ups and 'this'.

what is 'this' ?
it is not an author time binding but a runtime binding. it is contextual based on the function's invocation.
'this' binding is nothing to do with the 
where the function is declared, but instead has everything to do with 
the manner in which the function is invoked.

when a function is invoked, an execution context is created, it maintains the record of information about 
where the function was called from,
how function was invoked, 
parameters, local variables, scope chain, 
it also hold the record of the 'this' reference.

call site --------------
to understans 'this' binding, we have to first understand the call-site (location in code where a function is called, not where its is declared). it is like 'go locate where a function is called from'.

consider the code, think in terms of call-stack.
function baz() {
  console.log('baz');
  bar();
}
function bar() {
  console.log('bar');
  foo();
}
function foo() {
  console.log('foo');
}
baz();

call-stack keeps track of function execution. when a function is called, it is pushed into call-stack. once the function completes,
it is popped off the stack, and the interpreter returns to the function that called it.

in the above code, in global scope, baz is called, so stack will have baz inside it.
call-site is the global scope.

inside baz we have bar calling, so bar is pushed into stack. here stack will have baz,bar (side by side).
(when bar is called inside the baz, bar's EC will not be created inside the baz, instead new EC will be created independently of baz).
call-site for bar is inside the baz function.

inside bar we have foo calling, so foo is pushed into stack. here stack will have baz,bar,foo (side by side).
call-site for foo is inside the bar function.

when foo completes the execution, foo is popped out of stack,here stack will have baz,bar.
when bar completes the execution, bar is popped out of stack,here stack will have baz.
when baz completes the execution, baz is popped out of stack,here stack will have nothing.

Rules -----------------
after inspecting the call site, we see which rule is applicable.
1st rule/default binding rule : comes from function call/invocation. this rule is default catch-all rule. 
(if any other not applicable, then it is applicable).

first thing to note that when we declare a variable using 'var', in the global scope/outside the function, 
it becomes the property of the global object. (not let or const) so we can say that 
var a = 2;      ===       window.a = 2;         (in global scope)
we also know that 'var' is function scoped. so 'this' inside the function refers to the global object.

function foo() {
 console.log( this.a );
}
var a = 2;
foo();            // 2

here function foo is called in the global context, without any function reference, and since there is no other explicit binding,
'this' inside the foo refers to global obj. (so default binding rule).

if strict mode is applied, then call-site of foo is irrelevant.
function foo() {
 "use strict";
 console.log( this.a );
}
var a = 2;
foo();            // TypeError: `this` is `undefined`

2nd rule/implicit binding ------------
function foo() {
    console.log(this.a);
}
const obj = {
    a:2,
    foo : foo,
}
obj.foo();
foo();

when we declare the function foo, assign the foo function as property to the obj has nothing to do with the owning/containing by obj.
when function foo is called (the way in which it is called, see the call-site) we could say that obj contain/owns the function foo reference
at the time of function call.

so when there is an context object for function reference, the 2nd rule say that its that object that should be used for the function's
call 'this' binding. Because obj is the 'this' for the foo() call.
only the top level/last level of an object property reference matters to the call-site.

function foo() {
    console.log(this.a);
}
const obj = {
    a:24,
    foo : foo,
}
const obj2 = {
    a: 34,
    obj : obj,
}
obj2.obj.foo();          // 24

implicitly lost -------------------
function foo() {
    console.log(this.a);
}
var obj = {
    a: 2,
    foo : foo,
}
var bar = obj.foo;
var a = "it is global property";
bar();                              // it is global property

here, see the call-site of bar(), it is in global scope, not having any owning/contain. so default binfing.
it appears that bar() will refer the obj. but it is not the case.

same is true for callback function.
function foo() {
 console.log( this.a );
}
function doFoo(fn) {
 // `fn` is just another reference to `foo`
 fn(); // <-- call-site!
}
var obj = {
 a: 2,
 foo: foo
};
var a = "oops, global";          // `a` also property on global object
doFoo( obj.foo );                // "oops, global"


function foo() {
 console.log( this.a );
}
var obj = {
 a: 2,
 foo: foo
};
var a = "oops, global";           // `a` also property on global object
setTimeout( obj.foo, 100 );       // "oops, global"
